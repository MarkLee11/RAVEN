This is a React-based entertainment discovery and planning application built with modern web technologies.

## Key Information for Claude

### Tech Stack Context
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript

- **Icons**: Lucide React + custom SVG components

### Architecture Patterns
- **Component Structure**: Functional components with hooks
- **Routing**: File-based route organization in `src/routes/`
